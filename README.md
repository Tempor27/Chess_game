# Chess_game
This is a python program to play chess in the terminal

it is designed to be played by two human players

players begin by selecting piece to move. For example: wp, wb, wk (white pawn, white bishop, white king). The player is then prompted
to provide the starting location of that piece in 'y x' format. For example: 5 3. Rows and columns are labled on the board from 0-7. The
player must also provide the destination of the piece in the same format. If the move is legal, it is played and the next players turn begins.

The program can be run using python chess_game.py
